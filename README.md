job description:
React + Node - Full Stack Developer- 100% remote!

I’m hiring a Full Stack Engineer for our direct client to help them build out tools for public safety—think surveillance tech that actually helps first responders.

✅ 100% remote
✅ Real product ownership
✅ Backed by a big name in public safety
✅ You’d be building from scratch, not inheriting spaghetti

Can’t name the client just yet (NDA-bound), but it’s a high-visibility team inside a major player.
