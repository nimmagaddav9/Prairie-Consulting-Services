# âœ… React (Frontend) Answers

### 1. Tell me about your experience with full-stack development using React and Node.js.

**Sample Answer:**  
I have over 12 years of experience in UI development and have spent the last several years working extensively with React on the frontend and Node.js/Express (and NestJS) on the backend. Iâ€™ve led greenfield projects where I built scalable, responsive UI with React and Redux/Context API, integrated with RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and managed secure backend services using Node. Iâ€™ve also deployed apps to AWS using CI/CD pipelines and ensured logging, monitoring, and security were handled end-to-end.

### 2. How would you start designing a new application from scratch?

**Sample Answer:**  
Iâ€™d begin by understanding the key business requirements and user workflows, especially since this is for first respondersâ€”reliability and real-time features are crucial. Iâ€™d design the system using a modular frontend (React with functional components and hooks), backed by a RESTful or GraphQL API using Node.js/NestJS. I'd focus on a clean folder structure, reusable components, and API contracts. On the backend, Iâ€™d plan for scalability and security from day oneâ€”JWT-based auth, environment-based configs, and observability. Iâ€™d also use tools like Swagger or Postman for API documentation, and CI/CD for deployments.

### 3. How do you handle state management in large React applications?

**Sample Answer:**  
For simple cases, I use local state and the Context API. For more complex applicationsâ€”especially those involving user roles, alerts, and real-time updatesâ€”I use Redux or Zustand. I structure the store into logical slices, leverage middleware like Redux Thunk or Saga for async calls, and use selectors for performance optimization. I also use React Query when working with server-state-heavy apps to simplify data fetching, caching, and background updates.

### 4. How do you secure a Node.js backend?

**Sample Answer:**  
I ensure secure data transmission using HTTPS, use Helmet for HTTP headers, sanitize user inputs to avoid injection attacks, and implement authentication using JWT or OAuth. I follow the principle of least privilege for API access, use environment-based secrets with tools like AWS Secrets Manager, and implement proper error handling to avoid leaking internals. For audit trails, I log access and mutations securely, especially important in public safety tools.

### 5. How do you ensure performance and scalability in React apps?

**Sample Answer:**  
I use code-splitting with React.lazy and dynamic imports, memoization (`useMemo`, `React.memo`), and proper keying for lists to avoid unnecessary re-renders. I also debounce input-heavy interactions, lazy load non-critical components, and minimize bundle size with tree-shaking and Webpack optimizations. For real-time dashboards, I use WebSockets or polling efficiently to avoid excessive DOM updates.

### 6. Describe a situation where you had to work on a time-sensitive or high-visibility project.

**Sample Answer:**  
At UAL, I worked on a greenfield initiative to build a crisis communication dashboard for an airline. The project was highly visible and time-sensitive due to compliance. We followed agile, worked closely with stakeholders, and released the MVP in six weeks. I owned the frontend, collaborated with backend engineers to define API specs, and used automated testing to speed up delivery. This experience taught me how to thrive in high-pressure, high-impact environmentsâ€”much like this role seems to require.

### 7. How would you handle real-time data or alerting in a public safety app?

**Sample Answer:**  
For real-time updates like active incidents or responder locations, Iâ€™d use WebSockets via Socket.io or server-sent events, depending on the use case. On the backend, Iâ€™d publish updates to a Redis pub/sub or a message queue like SNS/SQS, and then broadcast changes to clients. On the frontend, Iâ€™d manage subscriptions, handle reconnections gracefully, and display notifications or UI updates without overwhelming the user.

### 8. How do you approach testing in a full-stack environment?

**Sample Answer:**  
I follow a layered testing strategy:

- Unit tests with **Jest** for React components and Node logic
- Integration tests with **React Testing Library** and **Supertest**
- End-to-end testing with **Cypress or Playwright**  
  I also automate testing in the CI pipeline, using code coverage tools and failing builds on regressions. For critical workflowsâ€”like alerting or loginâ€”I prioritize writing robust test cases.

### 9. Have you worked with CI/CD pipelines? What tools did you use?

**Sample Answer:**  
Yes. Iâ€™ve set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. For React + Node apps, I configure build, lint, test, and deploy steps. In AWS, Iâ€™ve deployed to S3 (frontend) and ECS or Lambda (backend) using Docker. I also integrate error logging (Sentry), monitoring (CloudWatch, Datadog), and alerts for post-deploy health checks.

### 10. Why are you interested in this role?

**Sample Answer:**  
Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to build something meaningful from scratchâ€”especially in the public safety space. The fact that itâ€™s a greenfield project with real product ownership really appeals to me. My past experience building critical, user-facing tools in regulated industries aligns well, and Iâ€™m confident I can contribute from day one.
